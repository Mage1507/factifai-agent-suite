## What is Factifai Suite?

Factifai Suite is a monorepo of packages that together form an AI-powered browser testing ecosystem. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret natural language test instructions and execute them through browser automation.

## Packages

This monorepo contains the following packages:

- **[factifai-agent](./packages/factifai-agent/)**: CLI tool that processes natural language test instructions and executes them via Playwright.
- **[playwright-core](./packages/playwright-core/)**: A wrapper around Playwright providing enhanced browser automation capabilities.

## How it Works

The packages work together in a layered architecture:

1. **playwright-core** handles the low-level browser automation
2. **factifai-agent** utilizes LLMs to process natural language instructions and orchestrates test execution via playwright-core

The test flow follows these steps:
- User provides natural language test instructions
- factifai-agent processes these instructions through a LangGraph pipeline
- Browser actions are executed via playwright-core
- Test results and reports are generated

## Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/presidio-oss/factifai-agent-suite.git
cd factifai-suite

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build all packages
pnpm -r build
```

## Development Commands

```bash
# Build all packages
pnpm -r build

# Build a specific package
pnpm --filter @presidio-dev/factifai-agent build

# Run tests
pnpm -r test

# Run a specific package's script
pnpm --filter @presidio-dev/factifai-agent start
```

## Prerequisites
